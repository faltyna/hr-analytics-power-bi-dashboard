# HR Analytics & Retention Dashboard 

This project focuses on analyzing Human Resources data to uncover insights into employee attrition, performance, and demographics. The goal was to transform raw data into a strategic tool for HR departments to improve employee retention.

## Project Overview
The analysis is based on a comprehensive HR dataset and includes a multi-page interactive Power BI report.

### Key Features:
* **Attrition Analysis:** Identifying key factors leading to employee turnover (e.g., job involvement, monthly income, overtime).
* **Workforce Demographics:** Insights into age groups, gender distribution, and department structures.
* **Performance Metrics:** Correlation between salary hikes, performance ratings, and years with current manager.
* **Star Schema Modeling:** Implementation of an efficient data model with fact and dimension tables.



## Tech Stack
* **Tool:** Power BI Desktop
* **Language:** DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated measures.
* **Data Source:** CSV (HR Analytics dataset).

## Repository Structure
* `HR_Analytics.csv`: The raw dataset used for the analysis.
* `Projekt_Faltyn_Osmala.pbix`: The complete Power BI report file (includes data model and visualizations).

## Key Conclusions
1. **Income vs. Attrition:** Employees with lower monthly income and high overtime are significantly more likely to leave the company.
2. **Career Growth:** Lack of recent promotions and low years in current role are major drivers of turnover in the R&D department.
3. **Age Trends:** The 25-35 age group shows the highest volatility, suggesting a need for better early-career engagement programs.
